  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">Introduction to Big Data Platforms</h2>
  <p>
    Big Data Platforms are a type of software that enable organizations to manage
    and analyze large volumes of data quickly and effectively. These platforms
    provide an integrated environment for data storage, processing, and
    analytics.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    They are capable of capturing, storing, and analyzing structured and
    unstructured data from a variety of sources. Big Data Platforms are used for a
    variety of use cases, including customer segmentation, fraud detection,
    predictive analytics, and more.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    They allow organizations to gain insights into their data and make informed
    decisions.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is Data?</h2>
  <p>
    Data is information that has been organized and structured in a way that makes
    it meaningful or useful. Data can come in many different forms, such as
    numbers, words, images, audio, and video. Data is used to inform decisions,
    discover patterns, and gain insight into the world around us.
  </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

<h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is big data?</h2>
  <p>
    Big data is a term used to describe large volumes of data that are too large
    and complex for traditional data processing software to deal with. This data
    includes both structured and unstructured data such as web logs, social media
    posts, videos, photos, and more. Big data is used by organizations to analyze,
    store, and visualize data to better understand customer behaviors, trends, and
    gain insights to improve products, services, and operations.
  </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>
   <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is Digital Data?</h2><p>Digital data is information that is stored and processed electronically, typically on a computer or other digital device. It is usually in the form of binary code, which can represent words, images, numbers, and other types of data. Digital data can be used for a variety of purposes, such as communication, entertainment, and data storage.</p></p>
  <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

    Challenges of Conventional Systems in Big Data
  </h2>
  <p>
    1. Scalability: Traditional systems are not designed to scale to handle the
    ever-growing amount of data.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    2. Storage Capacity: Traditional systems cannot store the large volumes of
    data.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    3. Processing Speed: Traditional systems cannot process the data quickly
    enough to keep up with the data generation rate.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    4. Flexibility: Traditional systems are not flexible enough to handle
    unstructured and semi-structured data.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    5. Security: Traditional systems are not secure enough to protect large data
    sets from unauthorized access.</p>
  <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">Data Types in Big Data</h2>
  <p>
    1. Structured Data: Structured data is data that has been organized into a
    schema or tabular structure. This type of data is typically stored in
    relational databases such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, etc. Examples include
    customer records, sales data, etc.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    2. Semi-structured Data: Semi-structured data is data that does not conform to
    a predefined structure. This type of data may be organized in a non-tabular
    format such as XML or JSON, but still contains identifiable characteristics or
    labels. Examples include log files, emails, etc.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    3. Unstructured Data: Unstructured data is data that does not conform to any
    predefined structure. This type of data may be text-based or multimedia-based,
    and can include images, audio, and video. Examples include social media posts,
    webpages, etc.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is Traditional BI&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) is a set of technologies and practices
    used by organizations to analyze data and make better business decisions. In
    the context of Big Data, traditional BI is used to access, organize, and
    analyze large volumes of structured and unstructured data.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    Traditional BI systems typically employ relational databases, complex query
    languages, data warehouses, and powerful analytics tools to gain insights from
    data.&nbsp;

    of data.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is SQL?</h2>
  <p>
    SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. It is a
    programming language used to manage data stored in relational databases.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    It is used to create, update, delete, and retrieve data from databases, as
    well as control user access to the data.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is NoSQL?</h2>
  <p>
    NoSQL (pronounced “no sequel”) stands for Not Only SQL. It is a non-relational
    database management system that does not use the traditional SQL language for
    manipulating data.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    NoSQL databases are designed to store and retrieve large amounts of data that
    may have little to no structure. They are often used to support real-time
    applications, such as web and mobile applications, that need to access and
    analyze large volumes of data quickly.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is NewSQL?</h2>
  <p>
    NewSQL is a class of modern relational database management systems that seek
    to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online
    transaction processing (OLTP) read-write workloads while still maintaining the
    ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    It combines the scalability of NoSQL databases with the consistency and rich
    functionality of traditional relational databases.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">Difference Between SQL, NoSQL and NewSQL</h2>
    <p>There are following difference with SQL, NoSQL and NewSQL-</p>
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">What is CAP Theorem?</h2>
  <p>
    Cap Theorem, also known as Brewer's Theorem, states that a distributed
    computer system can only guarantee two of the following three desirable
    properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. It states that
    a distributed system cannot provide all three guarantees at the same time.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <h2 class="tableHeadBoldTypeH2">Hadoop Installation?</h2>
  <p>
    Hadoop installation is the process of setting up a Hadoop environment on a
    network of computers. This process involves installing the Hadoop software,
    configuring it to run on the machines, and connecting the machines together to
